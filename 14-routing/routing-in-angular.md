Routing in Angular
====

Because of the way we interacted with servers for such a long time through urls,
browsers have implemented a ton of features around this idea. For example, the
back button, the history section, bookmarking, and sharing of urls through
email are all pretty common and expected things at this point.

Think about what we have so far with our single-page-applications. We have a lot
of functionality and state changes that come from user interaction with the
site, yet the url has stayed the same during the entire process. We need a way
within our SPA to update "where the user is". We can achieve this with some
services provided by angular.
